# 👋 Hi, I’m @LaMinerva 🇮🇹

## About Me  
I absolutely love reading 📚. Books  are my escape when I get some free time, and I’ll devour anything—from classics🗝☕🕰📜🎞🖋️ to cultivation fantasy🗡️ and sci-fi🛸. I’m also a big fan of manhwa (I also like manga, but manhwa... Webtoon is my go-to), and every now and then, I dive into some anime binge-watching sessions ˙✧˖°🍿 ༘ ⋆｡˚.  

My favorite philosophical areas are ontology⚛, epistemology🔬, phenomenology👁, and ethics⚖️.
Philosophy isn’t just a passion; I’m actually a philosophy graduate *on pause*. I need to finish 4 exams and add the CFU I’ll earn from my current ITS program to my degree. 

Right now, I’m in a 2-year ITS program in software architecture 💻⚙️🏛️, in which I hopefully will do an Erasmus apprenticeship to broaden my horizons even more 🗺️⁀જ✈︎🇪🇺. 
I’m pushing myself to get better at coding by taking on some fun and challenging projects.

## Hobbies  
- 🥋 I’ve done a lot of combat sports over the years -MMA, Judo, Kickboxing, Sanda, ecc...  
- 🏃‍♂️ Run few half-marathons.  
- ⚽ Socializing is my excuse for playing foosball (calcetto balilla), ping pong, **Yu-Gi-Oh! cards**, poker
- 🎮 Love the **The Sims 4** and **Total War: Rome II**.  

## Fun Fact  
I’d die for a 🌀 **omnicomprehension-universe-time-transcendence** 🌀 .   

## What I’m Working On  
I’m currently exploring ways to combine my love for coding with my other passions, like books, philosophy, and manhwa.  
Stay tuned for some cool projects!  ☎️
